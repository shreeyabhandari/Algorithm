### Sorting

Sorting  | Description
------------- | -------------
Selection sort  | At each step, put at the right position the smallest element
Bubble Sort  | If a element is bigger than the next adjacent element then swap them. Repeat until no swapping
Insertion Sort  | Add an element to a sorted list

### Data Structures

<b>Stack</b> is a container of objects that are inserted and removed according to the last-in first-out (LIFO) principle i.e. The last item added to the stack is the first one to be removed from the stack.</br>
<b>Queue</b> is a container of objects (a linear collection) that are inserted and removed according to the first-in first-out (FIFO) principle i.e. the items are removed from the queue in exactly the same order they were added to it.

<b>Stack Basic Operations</b>

operation  | Description
------------- | -------------
Create_Stack  | create a stack
Peek  |return the first item of the stack
Push  | add an element to the stack
Pop  |  remove an element of the stack
Is_Empty  | check whether the stack is empty

<b>Queue Basic Operations

operation  | Description
------------- | -------------
Create_Queue  | create a queue
Peek  |return the first item of the queue
Enqueue  | add an element to the queue
Dequeue  |  remove an element of the queue
Is_Empty  | check whether the queue is empty
