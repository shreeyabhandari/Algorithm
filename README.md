### Data Structures

<b>Stack</b> is a container of objects that are inserted and removed according to the last-in first-out (LIFO) principle i.e. The last item added to the stack is the first one to be removed from the stack.</br>
<b>Queue</b> is a container of objects (a linear collection) that are inserted and removed according to the first-in first-out (FIFO) principle i.e. the items are removed from the queue in exactly the same order they were added to it.

<b>Stack Basic Operations</b>

operation  | Description
------------- | -------------
create_stack  | create a stack
peek  |return the first item of the stack
push  | add an element to the stack
pop  |  remove an element of the stack
is_empty  | check whether the stack is empty

<b>Queue Basic Operations</b>

operation  | Description
------------- | -------------
create_queue  | create a queue
peek  |return the first item of the queue
enqueue  | add an element to the queue
dequeue  |  remove an element of the queue
is_empty  | check whether the queue is empty

### Sorting

Sorting  | Description
------------- | -------------
Selection sort  | At each step, put at the right position the smallest element
Bubble Sort  | If a element is bigger than the next adjacent element then swap them. Repeat until no swapping
Insertion Sort  | Add an element to a sorted list

### Dictionaries

* A collection of unordered items that are accessed via keys and not via their position.
* They consist of (key, value) pairs such that each possible key appears at most once.

Keys  | Family_Name | First_Name | age
------------- | -------------  | ------------- | -------------
Values  | Bhandari | Shreeya | 21
